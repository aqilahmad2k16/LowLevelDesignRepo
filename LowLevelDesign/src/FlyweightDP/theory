## Flyweight:-
	- structural pattern, aim to minimize the memory usage  or computational expenses of an application by 
	sharing as much as possible with related objects. It achieves this by sharing rather than replicating similar objects. 
	The pattern is particularly useful when a large number of similar objects need to be created.
	
	- here we separate properties into intrinsic and extrinsic properties 
	- intrinsic properties are those which will remain same for all the object 
	- extrinsic properties are those which might change for all object.
