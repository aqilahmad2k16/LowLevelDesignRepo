## Decorator Design Pattern:
	- The decorator design pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to an object.
	- decorator adds it's own behaviour before or/and after delegating to the object if decorators to to rest of the job.
	-  It involves creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components, 
	enhancing their functionalities in a flexible and reusable way.
